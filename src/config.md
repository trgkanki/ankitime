## alarmFile (default: "")

Path of custom alarm sound. Note that path in windows should be backslash-escaped, as denoted on [JSON spec](https://www.json.org/) For example, path `C:\Users\whyask37\music.mp3` becomes

```json
{
  "alarmFile": "C:\\Users\\whyask37\\music.mp3"
}
```

Just remember to replace all occurrence of `\` with `\\`.
